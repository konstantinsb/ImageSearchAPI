Hello everyone! Its my first project on GitHub.
Test for Ios junior job
Here is a test task.
/*
You need to create an app that will search images on Google by the query text.
 The API that must return the result is described here:
 https://serpapi.com/images-results
 The page must look like the page of the NavigationController where a search field must be placed
 on the top of the page where users can write the text for the query. The result images must be
 shown below the search field as a collection view.
 A tap on the preview image must open an image in the full screen view with buttons “Next” and
 “Prev” that allow users to view previous and next images from the search result. Also, please add
 a button to open the original source page. Clicking on that button must open a website on Web
 View Controller inside the app. Users can close that Web View to return to images.
 It will be good if the images are cached on a device
